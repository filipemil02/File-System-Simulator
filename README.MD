# File System Simulator in C

This project is a simulation of a basic file system implemented in C. It provides a command-line interface for users to interact with a virtual file system. Users can perform common file system operations such as creating files and directories (`touch`, `mkdir`), listing files and directories (`ls`), deleting files and directories (`rm`, `rmdir`), changing the current directory (`cd`), printing the current directory path (`pwd`), and searching for files or directories (`find`). This project is a great way to understand the underlying operations of a file system.
